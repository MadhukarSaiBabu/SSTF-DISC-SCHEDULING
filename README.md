# SSTF-DISC-SCHEDULING
The Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) disk scheduling project aims to implement an efficient algorithm that enhances disk performance by minimizing the seek time during data access. In disk scheduling, seek time refers to the time required for the read/write head to move to the track where data is stored. SSTF improves upon basic scheduling techniques by selecting the disk I/O request that is closest to the current head position, thereby reducing unnecessary head movements and improving overall system efficiency. This project involves simulating the SSTF algorithm, analyzing its performance, and comparing it with other scheduling strategies in terms of average seek time and response time. The implementation showcases how SSTF effectively balances speed and simplicity, making it a suitable choice for various operating system environments. Through this project, learners gain practical insight into how disk scheduling impacts system performance and the trade-offs involved in algorithm selection.
