# SSTF-DISC-SCHEDULING
The goal of the SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) disk scheduling project is to implement a disk scheduling algorithm that optimizes seek time and enhances the disk's overall efficiency. The SSTF algorithm prioritizes the next request that is nearest to the current head position, thereby minimizing the seek time needed to access data.
